# social_network_simulator

Ideas:

Person objects with traits. Such as personality traits (introvert, energetic, depressive, workoholic), hobbies (different classes that might have differentiators on how social the activity is, or if it it related to some other hobbie), and profession and/or work place (which might have it's own set or differentiators and trait couplings).
Persons might also have trackers for current energy level, happiness and material wellbeing
Traits influence how the trackers are adjusted in different situations, and persons evaluate expected change before deciding if they attend. Total state value is probably determined ?linearly/sqarely? with distance below comfort threashold (might skip theashold upwards and have some rule of diminishing returns)
Events with expected trait association that persons can decide to attend
Meetings that only happen if certain invited people attend
On events and meetings people meet other attending people randomly, biased by prior likeing. And this infuences personal trackers and likeing of the other people in relation to how the other people affected tracker updates.
People might need to track who they know, or at least who they like
Attraction might be a separate random matching of hidden traits that people cannot evaluate beforehand, but influences likeing massively, and could trigger separate needs like intimacy.
